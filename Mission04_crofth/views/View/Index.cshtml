<p>
    I'm super excited to learn a new programming language (C#) and how to do actual application development in this class.
    I already know a bit of web developement and other programming langauges like C++, Python, Javascript, and others, but this class seems like it'll open up a ton of new possibilities.
    This is going to be a lot of fun!
